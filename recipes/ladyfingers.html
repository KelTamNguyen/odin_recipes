        <h1 class="title">Ladyfingers</h1>
        <img class="cookie-img" src="../images/ladyfingers.jpg">
        <p>Type: Molded Cookie</p>
        <p><em>With their pale, delicate coloring and long narrow form that resembles the gracefully tapering 
            fingers of a refined lady, it is easy to see how <strong>ladyfingers</strong> got their name.</em> 
            In Italy, these soft, spongy cookies are called <em>savoiardi</em>, meaning "from Savoy". They are 
            also called <em>sponge biscuits, boudoir biscuits, biscuits &agrave; la cuillier</em>. They are 
            usually soft yellow and dusted with confectioners' sugar before baking to give them a crisp crust 
            that yields to the light, spong cake-like center.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ladyfingers are a base for desserts such as tiramisu, charlottes, and trifles, where they are used to
            form an elegant border for the filling inside. Because they are often soaked in syrups or covered in 
            soft mousses as part of a dessert, ladyfingers are sometimes made somewhat dry. Ladyfingers are part 
            of the sponge cake or <em>genoise</em> cake family (cake made with no leaveners). Air is incorporated 
            into the batter by vigorously whipping the eggs; these air bubbles are what gives the cookies their 
            light texture.
        </p>
        <h2 class="page-content">History</h2>
        <p>
            Ladyfingers were first created in the Duchy of Savoy in the 15th Century, to mark a visit from the King 
            of France. Their popularity slowly spread through Europe, especially to Italy and England.
        </p>
        <h2 class="page-content">Serving Suggestions</h2>
        <p>
            Ladyfingers are a wonderful, dainty teatime treat on their own, but they are also good spread with a little 
            jam or honey. And ladyfingers work well in many desserts where a soft bake is needed, such as parfaits or trifles; 
            they can be crumpled into pieces and layered with fruit and whipped cream. Ladyfingers are often the cake layer of 
            choice for making tiramisu, as they soak up the espresso and rum flavors very well. Make beautiful charlottes by lining 
            a trifle bowl with ladyfingers to form a border and filling the center with whipped cream, berries or mousse.

        <h2 class="page-content">Baking Notes</h2>
        <p>
            Because ladyfingers defend on air whipped into the batter for leavening, it is important not to let the eggs deflate once they 
            have been whipped. Fold egg whites into the dough using gentle, careful motions, and stop once it looks like they have just combined. 
            Always use a lift-and-scoop motion, not a stirring motion, to avoid deflating the eggs. If you want slightly crispier sturdier cookies, 
            leave them in the oven for 5 more minutes until they turn golden brown.
        </p>
        <h2 class="page-content">Recipe (makes about 3 dozen cookies)</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients-list">
            <li>1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 egg whites at room temperature</li>
            <li>3 egg yolks at room temperature</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon sugar for whipping egg yolks</li>
            <li>Confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 375&deg;F. Stack 4 cookie sheets together in pairs: You need to double up the sheets to avoid drying out the 
                ladyfingers. Line the top sheets with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Fit a pastry bag with a #6 plain round pastry 
                tip, and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Sift the flour into  a bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, whip the whites on medium-high speed until foamy.</li>
            <li>
                With the mixer on low, add the sugar for the egg whites in a slow stream. Increase mixer speed to high and whip until stiff 
                peaks form. Do not overwhip: Whites should be glossy, not chalky. Scrape whites into a separate bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the stand mixer with the whisk attachment and a clean bowl, whip the egg yolks on medium-high speed for a few minutes to 
                break up the yolks.
            </li>
            <li>Gradually add the sugar for the egg yolks in a slow stream. Whip on high speed until mixture is pale and thickened.</li>
            <li>Gently fold in the whipped whites in 3 additions using a spatula.</li>
            <li>Very gently fold in the sifted flour in 2 additions.</li>
            <li>
                Once you have finished the batter, work quickly before the batter deflates. Fill the pastry bag with half of the batter and pipe 
                the batter onto the cookie sheets. When piping, the tip of the pastry bag should be at a 45&deg; angle to the pan. Gently pipe 
                batter, forming ladyfingers that are 3/4 inch wide by 4 inches long.
            </li>
            <li>
                Continue piping the batter in the same manner. Once all the batter is piped, sift confectioners' sugar over the ladyfingers twice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until lightly golden in color. Cool completely before removing with a metal spatula.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="page-content">Storage</h2>
        <p>
            Store in an airtight container for 3 days. If you are not going to use the ladyfingers right away, they  will go stale quickly, so 
            store them in the freezer until ready to use them.
