    <em><strong>Peanut butter blossoms</strong> are small peanut butter cookies that
     are pressed down with a chocolate kiss.</em> Also known as 
     <em>Black-Eyed Susans</em>, they are popular throughout 
     the United States and Canada.
  </p>
  <h2 class="page-content">History</h2>
  <p>
    Peanut butter blossoms are a relatively recent cookie
    invention. Hershey introduced their Chocolate
    kisses in 1907, and <strong>peanut butter cookies</strong> gained
    popularity in the 1930s. Recipes like this one have
    been made popular by a number of cookbooks and 
    women's magazines, from <em>Betty Crocker</em> to 
    <em>Better Homes and Gardens</em>.
  </p>
  <h2 class="page-content">Serving Suggestions</h2>
  <p>Serve peanut butter blossoms with a tall glass of milk, any time of the year.</p>
  <h2 class="page-content">Baking Notes</h2>
  <p>
    Do not use natural peanut butter in these cookies as
    it is formulated differently and will separate when 
    baking. It is very important to wait until the very end of
    baking to add the chocolate kisses, otherwise they
    will melt.
