        <h2 class="page-content">General Description</h2>
        <p>
            <em>Few cookies are as deeply entrenched in the culture and history of a nation as these fiber-filled, travel-hardy oatmeal biscuits.</em>
            Affectionately known as <em>bikkies</em>, ANZAC biscuits are national favorites in Australia and New Zealand, where they can be found in supermarkets, 
            "biscuit shops," and restaurants year-round, but are baked in great numbers on ANZAC Day, April 25. ANZAC biscuits may have evolved from Scottish rolled
            oat cake recipes or <strong>rock cakes</strong>.
        </p>
        <h2 class="page-content">History</h2>
        <p>
            During World War II, two division of Australian and New Zealand soldiers joined to create the Australia and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC). They were sent 
            to Egypt for training, and they brought simple, travel-worthy oatmeal cookies. The courageous ANZAC forces became renowned for their valiant service at 
            Gallipoli, Turkey. In 1920, April 25 was declared ANZAC day, celebrated in Australia, New Zealand, Cook Islands, Tonga, and Samoa. It has since been expanded
            into a day that honors all who served in World War I, II, Korea, and Vietnam. Tins of ANZAC biscuits are often sold as fundraising for veterans, and they are 
            used as Australian military rations to this day.
        </p>
        <h2 class="page-content">Serving Suggestions</h2>
        <p>
            These biscuits make a durable, nutritious meal for hikers, traavelers, and Australian bushwalkers. ANZAC biscuits are commonly dunked in tea or dark coffee.

        <h2 class="page-content">Baking Notes</h2>
        <p>
            The tasty biscuits are unusual for their lack of (perishable) eggs as well as their long baking time. Golden syrup, rendered from inverted sugar, is widey
            popular throughout the world, but less so in America. Although it can be found in the United States, it can be replaced with treacle, light corn syrup, or
            maple syrup.
