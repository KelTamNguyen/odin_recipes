                <p>
                    <em><strong>Black and White Cookies</strong> are soft, cakelike, lightly lemony cookies with distinctive icing.</em> The frosted top-one half chocolate icing, 
                    the other half vanilla icing-is the distinguishing chracteristic. The typical black and white cookie is oversized at 3.5 to 4 inches in diameter.
                    The cakey texture of the cookies has given it the reputation of a "cookie made of cake batter," but most recipes for the cookie do not have the same
                    ingredient proportions as that of a cake. The icing is sometimes a creamy fondant, or sometimes a thinner, harder consistency, but it is always made 
                    with confectioners' sugar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    New York City is strongly affiliated with the black and white cookie, and many residents consider the black and white cookie an unofficial symbol of
                    the city. In other parts of America, the cookie is sometimes called a half-moon cookie, and in Germany a version of the cookie is called the 
                    <em>Amerikaner</em> ("American").

                    <h3>Directions:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat oven to 375&deg;F. Grease several cookie sheets.</li>
                        <li>Stir flour, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl and set aside.</li>
                        <li>In a stand mixer, beat butter on medium to medium-high speed for several minutes until smooth.</li>
                        <li>
                            With the mixer on low speed, add sugar in a slow stream. Cream butter and sugar on medium-high speed for several minutes until very light 
                            (almost white) and fluffy.
                        </li>
                        <li>Add both extracts, then add egg whites one at a time; mix to combine between each addition.</li>
                        <li>Add the flour mixture and milk in alternating additions, 3 additions of each starting with the flour mixture. Mix just until combined.</li>
                        <li>Drop 1/4 cup-sized scoops of dough onto cookie sheets, about 5 inches apart.</li>
                        <li>
                            Wet a small offset spatula or butter knife with water. Spread each cookie into a 3-inch round, creating as smooth a surface as possible.
                            Continue to wet spatula as needed to smooth each top.
                        </li>
                        <li>Bake 8-10 minutes, rotating sheets halfway through, until edges are just about to turn golden. Cool sheets on wire racks.</li>
                        <li>
                            For the icing: Mix the confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla in a bowl until smooth. Transfer half of the icing to another bowl and add cocoa powder. 
                            Be sure to mix until cocoa powder lumps have disappeared. Using a small offset spatula, spread the chocolate icing on half of the cookie. Follow with the
                            vanilla icing on the other half.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Allow the iced cookies to set for 30 minutes on wire racks, then remove them with a metal spatula.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        Black and White cookies first appeared in New York during the 1940s. Hemstrought's Bakery in Utica claims the honor of originating the cookie; however, 
                        black and white cookies quickly became ubiquitous among bakeries and delis in New York City.

                    <p>
                        If you don't want the traditional mild lemon flavor, omit it and use only vanilla extract. Frost the cookie entirely in chocolate or white icing for a
                        nontraditional look.

                    <summary>Baking Notes</summary>
                    <p>
                        Avoid overbaking; the hallmark of this cookie is its soft, moist, cakelike texture. The easiest way to frost the cookies quickly and smoothly is with a 
                        small offset spatula. To avoid making a mess, place the finished, cooled cookies on a wire rack over a piece of wax paper to catch the drips. To make a 
                        straight line down the center, use the sptula to lightly mark a dividing line on the cookie before you frost it.
