    <h1 class="title">Chinese Almond Cookies</h1>
    <img src="../images/Chinese-Almond-Cookies.jpg">
    <h2>General Description</h2>
    <p>
        <em>This traditional Chinese-American cookie is light and crispy with a mild buttery, nutty flavor.</em> It has a shiny, crackly top
        and is often decorated with sliced almonds. The cookie's shiny, golden appearance comes from the egg glaze applied to the top before
        baking, although yellow food coloring may be made with butter or shortening. They are often served at Chinese restaurants at the end 
        of a meal, along with orange slices, or given as hostess gifts or party treats.
    </p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        Chinese immigrants to America adapted the traditional Chinese walnut cookie into the popular almond cookie in the 1800s. In America, April 9
        has been designated National Chinese Almond Cookie Day. Twin Dragon, one of the nist enduring commercial makers of Chinese almond cookies, 
        packages them in pink boxes tied with red string. These iconic cookie boxes are sold in nearly every Chinese grocery store year-round.
    </p>
    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>
        The cookie is a natural partner to Chinese teas, especially oolong or green teas. It is traditionally served with fresh apple or orange slices.

    <h2>Baking Notes</h2>
    <p>
        This cookie adapts well to Asian spices like ginger, Chinese five spice, or star anise. The almonds in Chinese almond cookies can be replaced
        with other nuts, such as walnuts or pine nuts. Many Chinese almond cookie recipes call for only regular flour, although some ground almonds enhance 
        the sweet nuttiness of the cookie: try substituting 1/2 cup of the flour with 1/2 cup of ground almond to increase the almond flavor.

    <h2>Recipe (makes about 3 dozen cookies)</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup softened unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sliced almonds for decoration</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten for egg wash</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt into a medium bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat butter on medium speed until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add the egg and almond extract, and mix until combined.</li>
        <li>Add the flour mixture and mix on low speed until just combined.</li>
        <li>Turn out dough onto a piece of plastic wrap, and form into a disk. Cover dough and refrigerage for about 20 minutes until firm.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325&deg;F. Grease several cookie sheets or line them with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough into 1-inch balls and place on the sheets about 1 inch apart. Flatten them with the palm of your hand.</li>
        <li>
            Place a sliced almond in the center of each ball of dough. Brush a little of the egg wash over the top of the cookie. Bake for 12 
            to 15 minutes, rotating cookie sheets halfway through; the cookies will start to turn golden at the edges when done. Cool sheets on 
            wire racks for a few minutes before trnsferring cookies to wire racks to finish cooling.
        </li>
    </ol>
